E.g. Copying all .txt files from /tmp/a into /tmp/b.
Usual syntax:
$ cp /tmp/a/* /tmp/b/ #Copies all files
$ cp /tmp/a/*.txt /tmp/b/ #Copies all .txt files
$ cp /tmp/a/*.html /tmp/b/ #Copies all .html files

E.g. Rename all .txt files to .bak files? How to do it?
mv *.txt *.bak won't have the desired effect. 

What is difference between "echo /tmp/a/*" and "ls /tmp/a/"?
