How to display "Hello "World""?
echo "Hello \"World\""

But if we use echo "Hello	"World"", it would be interpreted as such, 
First parameter is "Hello	", second is World, and third is "".

(*, ' are not taken literally.)

E.g.
echo * #lists all the files
echo *.txt #Lists all .txt files
echo "*" #Outputs *
echo "*.txt" #Outputs .txt

However ", $, ` and \ are still interpretd by ths shell.
\ is used to mark special characters..
