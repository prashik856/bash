Test is used by virtually every shell script written. "test" is not often called directly. "test" is more frequently called as "[". "[" is symbolic link to test. 

So that means, whenever we use "[" in a script, we need to have spaces between them (else, it will have problem interpreting that).

so, if[$foo = "bar" ] will not work as it will be interpreted as if test$foo = bar, which is "]" without beginning "[".

Some shells accept "==" for string comparisons. Since it is not portable, a single "=" should be used for strings. or "-eq" for integers.

Running "man test" will open the manual of test binary.

Test is often invoked in "if" and "while" statements.
Due to this reason, we cannot create a program called "test" and run it, as it will call the shell builtin.

1) if else statements
if [ ... ]
then
	#if code
else
	#else code
fi
#Notice that "fi" is "if" backwards. This is used again later with "case" and "esac".
Also, if [ ... ] and then must be on different lines.Alternatively, the semicolon ";" can separate them;
if [ ... ]; then
	#Do something
fi

We can also use "elif", like this:
if [ something ]; then
	echo "Something"
	elif [ something_else ]; then
		echo "something_else"
	else
		echo "None of the above"
fi

2) Integer comparisions in shell:
we use the below statements to compare:
-lt, -gt, -le, -ge

For string to get a non zero lenght:
-n
usage: if [ -n "$X" ] , here X is a string

For a path of a real file
-f
usage: if [ -f "$X" ] , here X is a file path

For a path of executable file
-x
usage: if [ -x "$X" ] , here X is a executable file path

For newer than, when time is imp
usage: if [ "$X" -nt "/etc/passwd" ] , here it will check if X is a file which is newer than /etc/passwd.
We can use ";" to join 2 lines together. The backslash "\" serves a similar but opposite purpose. it tells shell that this is not the end of the line, but that the following line should be treated as a part of the current line. This is useful for readability. It is customary to indent the following line after a "\" or semicolon.
