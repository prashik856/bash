# AWK Tutorial


## Using ps command
```shell
ps
# Will give us all process running

ps | awk '{print $1}'
# Will give us first column
 
ps | awk '{print $2}'
# Will give us second column

ps | awk '{print $0}'
# Will print everything again

ps | awk '{print}'
# Will again print everything

ps -ef
# Prints detailed commands running by their respective
# PIDs

ps -ef | awk '{}'
```

## Using a custom delimeter
```shell
cat /etc/passwd
# The values are separated by : rather than a space ( )

awk -F ":" '{print $1}' /etc/passwd
# this will print the first column. We have taken
# separator as : here.

awk -F ":" '{print $1 $6 $7}' /etc/passwd
# will print all columns without any delimiter between 
# Them

awk -F ":" '{print $1" "$6" "$7}' /etc/passwd
# Will print multiple columns with space as delimeter
# between them

awk -F ":" '{print $1"\t"$6"\t"$7}' /etc/passwd
# Will print multiple columns with tab as delimeter
# between them

awk -F ":" '{print $1"-"$6"-"$7}' /etc/passwd
# Will print multiple columns with dash - as delimeter
# Between them

awk 'BEGIN{FS=":"; OFS="-"} {print $1,$6,$7}' /etc/passwd
# This will work the same as the above command.
```

## Using Regex
```shell
cat /etc/shells
awk -F "/" '{print $NF}' /etc/shells
# This will print the first three lines as well which 
# Starts with #. This is unwanted. To avoid this, 
# We will use regex to identify lines which starts
# with /
# NF will print the last column

awk -F "/" '/^\// {print $NF}' /etc/shells
# We need to give the expression inside //.
# the regex expression here ^\/ means that we
# need to get line which starts with /.

awk -F "/" '/^#/ {print $NF}' /etc/shells
# Fetches line which starts with # and prints the last
# column.

awk -F "/" '/^\// {print $NF}' /etc/shells
# NF is maybe the last column
# Here, we will first fetch the output with just columns
# as output

awk -F "/" '/^\// {print $NF}' /etc/shells | uniq
# uniq - Gives unique output in the last column output

awk -F "/" '/^\// {print $NF}' /etc/shells | uniq | sort
# sort - Sorts the output provided by uniq
```

## Length Function
```shell
cat /etc/shells

awk 'length($0) > 8' /etc/shells
# Prints all lines whose length of first column value
# Is greater than 8

awk 'length($0) <= 8' /etc/shells
# Prints all lines whose length of first column value
# Is less than or equal to 8
```

## Using regex and operators
```shell
df
# outputs system volumes used

df | awk '/\/dev\/disk/ {print $1}'
# Will output the first column of every line which
# includes /dev/disk

df | awk '/\/dev\/disk/ {print $1"\t"$2"\t"$3}'
# Outputs the 1st, 2nd and 3rd column of every line
# Which has /dev/disk in them

df | awk '/\/dev\/disk/ {print $1"\t"$2 + $3}'
# Outputs 2 columns, $1 and $2+$3. It will add all the 
# values of column 1 and column 2 with their respective
# rows.

df | awk '/\/dev\/disk/ {print $1"\t"$2 - $3}'
# Outputs 2 columns, $1 and $2-$3. It will subtract all the 
# values of column 2 from column 1 with their respective
# rows.
```

## Conditional statements
### if condition inside awk
```shell
ps -ef

ps -ef | awk '{ if($NF == "-zsh") print$0}'
# The awk statement will check if the last column value
# of the line matches /bin/fish and print the 
# line
```

### for loop inside awk
```shell
awk 'BEGIN { for(i=1; i<=10; i++) print "The square value of", i, "is", i*i;}'
# We use a for loop in begin, and then we use the print 
# command to print the i*i values
```

### Using Regex 2
```shell
awk '$1 ~/^[b,c,d,e,f]/  {print $0}' ~/.bashrc
# It will first print the file, and then 
# select the lines which starts with 
# either b,c,d,e, or f. It will then print the
# all the columns.

awk 'match($0, /o/) {print $0 " has \"o\" character at " RSTART}' numbered.txt
# Using the match function,
# We will check which line has character o in it.
# And we will print the index of every match.
# Index is given by the variable RSTART
```

### Using substr() function
```shell
cat numbered.txt

awk '{print substr($0, 4)}' numbered.txt
# Print only the second column of the numbered file
# Print every line but only after the fourth character
```

### Line Manipulation
```shell
df 
df | awk 'NR==7, NR==11 {print NR, $0}'
# NR = number of records
# Line number
# The values inside {} are called action
# This will first select everything from line 7 to line 11, 
# Then it will first print the line number and 
# all of the contents of that line

df | awk 'NR==7, NR==11 {print $0}'
# Same output as above but without the line number

# Give line count
awk 'END {print NR}' /etc/shells
# Gives out number of lines in /etc/shells file

awk 'END {print NR}' /etc/shells /etc/passwd
# Gives the output as the sum of number of lines
# in these two files
```
