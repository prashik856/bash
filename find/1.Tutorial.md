# Find command

## Basics
```shell
find /Users/prraut -name *.txt
# Any file that ends with .txt


# What if we don't need a hidden directory results?
find /Users/prraut -name *.txt | grep -v .cache
# Get result without .cache hidden directory

# What if we are only interested in files or directories
find . -name Documents
# Find something that is exactly named documents!
# This gives out tons of results

# Only return files not directories
find . -name Documents -type f

# Only return directories
find . -name Documents -type d

# Delete all files whose name is Documents
find . -type f -name Documents -exec rm {} +
# Understanding exec command
# exec - execute command against every item in the result
# We want to run 'rm' command against every item
# {} is the placeholder for the actual item.
# + is the terminator. The end of the command

find . -type f -name Documents -exec rm {} \;
# ; - another way to terminate a command. But we need to 
# Add another backslash (\) in front of it to escape it.
# We need to terminate find command whenever we execute
# find with exec.

# Change permissions with a single command
# For this, we can use chmod
chmod -R 600 RandomPicture
# -R is for recursively going inside everything
# 600 - remove every permission except to user.
# After running this, we can get weired results for 
# RandomPicture directory
ls -l RandomPicture
# looking ourselves out of the directory

chmod -R u+x RandomPicture
# u+x - user and execute
# But if we have pictures inside RandomPicture, that
# means we have given execute permissions to all types
# of files including .jpg, .jpej, etc.

find RandomPicture/ -type f -exec chmod 600 {} +
# Execute chmod 600 command to only files

# Run only on directories
find RandomPicture/ -type d -exec chmod 700 {} +

ls -l /var/log/
# Clear every log file that does ends with
# just .log
# The below command will work
find /var/log -type f -name *.log.* -exec truncate -s 0 {} +
# We will truncate every log file with size 0.
# Essentially deleting it

find . -name *.mp3
# Simple search for all files that end with .mp3
