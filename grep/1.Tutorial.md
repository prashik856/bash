# Grep

We give a pattern to match. 

```shell
grep string path/to/file
# Will return every line that has string in it

grep export ~/.zshrc
# Returns all lines that has export in it.

grep the ~/.zshrc
# What if we only want to match the, not then, thereafter, etc
# To do that, we can use -w

grep -w export ~/.zshrc
# Grep for a specific word, not a pattern.

# Grep cannot search a file unless it is written in
# text
# Searching with a directory gives us an error
grep name  /Users
# Output - grep: /Users: Is a directory

# Run it on all files inside a directory
grep dore ~/Documents/OCI/Errors/*
# Will give us bunch of lines which as stevedore in it

# Exclude directories
grep dore ~/Documents/OCI/Errors/* --exclude-dir={hello,hi}
# Grep command will work the same except it will 
# exclude executing grep command for hello and hi 
# directories

# Sticking on a single file now
# Using Regex with multiple characters
grep "[aeiou]" ~/.zshrc
# find all lines that has either a,e,i,o or u in it.

# Range of characters
grep "[a-z]" ~/.zshrc
# Will return all lines that has any small alphabet in it.

grep "^ex" ~/.zshrc
# Something that starts with ex

grep -A 3 export ~/.zshrc
# A (after), B(before), and C() flag
# Return the line which has export in it, it will
# also return 3 lines after the match
# Useful when we need some context around of what
# we are searching for

grep -A 3 -i export ~/.zshrc
# -i flag takes care of case sensitivity.

grep -B 3 -i export ~/.zshrc
# Will also return 3 lines before the matched line

grep -C 3 -i export ~/.zshrc
# Will return 3 lines before and 3 lines after
# the matched line

grep -Hn -i export ~/.zshrc
# -H - return the name of the file
# n - print the line number for this particular pattern

grep -c -i export ~/.zshrc
# c - get count, or number of occurances

cat ~/.zshrc | grep export 
# Works the same
# But never to cat and pipe it in a grep
# This is because we are running two programs
# Which is unnecessary
